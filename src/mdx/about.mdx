I entered the software development world after earning my Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), where I learned the fundamentals to write quality code.

I am passionate about turning complex problems into simple and efficient solutions. I am a curious person who never stops learning and expanding my skill set.

I work primarily in [React](https://reactjs.org), [Redux](https://redux.js.org), [Python](https://python.org) and [Elasticsearch](https://elastic.co) in my current position. The development process consists of Test-driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approaches, with a continuous pipeline set up on GitLab CI/CD with using [Docker](https://docker.com) containers. I also have experience working in a wide range of languages and technologies including [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [Java](https://java.com), [ASP.NET C#](https://asp.net) and many more.

When I am not glued to my screen, you will find me traveling (pre-COVID) and working on cars. Let's chat!
