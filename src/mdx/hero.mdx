## Hello, I'm Nicky.
# I'm a full stack developer from Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.
I have 4+ years of experience in front end development. I currently develop full stack web applications with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Python](https://python.org), and build static sites with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org). I also enjoy working in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Java](https://java.com) and [ASP.NET C#](https://asp.net).
